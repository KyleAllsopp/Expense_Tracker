# Expense Tracker

Utilizing Python to create a template for an expense tracker. Ideally you could use this to track the expenses associated with each of the employees at a company.
While we did not go into huge detail as we did not have actual data to work with, given time to revisit, we would like to implement predictive models to predict the cost of hiring new employees. 

Instructions for how to run this is located inside the notebook.

This was created in collaboration with Salman Hairder as a project in our Python class.
